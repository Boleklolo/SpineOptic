Warning! This might get flagged as malware for some reason. Please exclude it in your anti virus. I have no idea what causes that but I'll work on it.

Created to learn C# and Windows Forms and also just to take care for our eyes and backs.
The app is low-weight and uses up to 42MB of RAM on idle.

The app shows notifications for posture checks and 20/20/20 rule.

20/20/20 rule - Each 20 minutes, look away at something 20 feet (6m) away for 20 seconds.
The app is utterly broken, will be fixed in 1.1

Instructions
  Open the program, to open dashboard right click it's icon on toolbox and press "Dashboard"
Here you can find value boxes for each part's timer (In seconds) and a theme manager. Pretty simple. There is no autosave yet (though one is planned for 1.1 if it ever releases). For now though you'll have to stick to Save Config option on top of the screen. Load Config is pretty useless as the config is loaded with each start of the program and the other values are kept until it's shut down. 

If you want to compile it yourself, you'll have to download a package with powershells scripts (included in releases)

If you want the program to start automatically, simply click Win + R, type in "shell::startup" and put a shortcut to the program there.

Custom Themes:

THIS FEATURE DOESNT WORK DUE TO CHEATFIELD NOT WORKING, TRY EDITING isCusCheat IN CONFIG INSTEAD 

  To get a custom theme, open about in dashboard and put in the code 1337. This will unlock custom theme option in themes. Then simply put a 542x185 image named "CustomTheme.png" to the program's dir, don't forget to save and reload the program.
